# What Are DEFCON Groups?

## Overview

DEFCON Groups are local chapters of security enthusiasts, hackers, and cybersecurity professionals that meet regularly around the world. These groups serve as year-round extensions of the famous DEFCON hacker conference, fostering local communities of learning, networking, and knowledge sharing.

## The DEFCON Hacker Conference

DEFCON is one of the world's largest and most influential hacker conventions, held annually in Las Vegas since 1993. Founded by Jeff Moss (Dark Tangent), DEFCON brings together:

- Security researchers and professionals
- Hackers and enthusiasts
- Government personnel
- Students and academics
- Industry professionals

The conference features:
- Technical presentations and workshops
- Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions
- Villages focused on specific topics (IoT, lockpicking, social engineering, etc.)
- Networking opportunities
- Hands-on learning experiences

## DEFCON Group Naming Convention

DEFCON Groups follow a unique naming convention rooted in telecommunications history:

### The Phreaking Connection

The naming system is based on **area codes**, which traces back to the historical connection between hacking and **phreaking** (phone hacking). In the early days of hacking culture:

- Phone systems were among the first networks hackers explored
- "Phone phreaks" discovered ways to manipulate telephone networks
- Area codes became symbolic identifiers within the community
- This tradition carried forward into modern hacker culture

### Example: DC381 (Serbia)

**DC381** represents the DEFCON Group for Serbia:
- **DC** = DEFCON
- **381** = Serbia's country calling code
- This follows the pattern while adapting to international contexts

Other examples:
- DC505 (Albuquerque, New Mexico - area code 505)
- DC214 (Dallas, Texas - area code 214)
- DC44 (London, UK - country code 44)

## Purpose and Activities

DEFCON Groups typically organize:
- Monthly or bi-weekly meetings
- Technical presentations and talks
- Hands-on workshops and training
- Local CTF competitions
- Social networking events
- Community outreach and education

These groups maintain the DEFCON spirit of open learning, curiosity, and ethical hacking throughout the year, making cybersecurity knowledge accessible to local communities worldwide.
