# Attending Your First Meetup

## The Essence of DEFCON Groups: In-Person Connection

DEFCON Groups exist primarily for **in-person meetups**. While online platforms and digital resources are valuable supplements, the heart and soul of any DEFCON Group is the face-to-face gathering where real connections are made, knowledge is shared organically, and the hacker community spirit thrives.

## Keep It Simple: Just Show Up

### The Most Important Step

**Just show up and say hi.** That's it. No complicated preparation, no extensive research, no perfect introduction planned. The cybersecurity community values authenticity over polish, and curiosity over credentials.

### Finding Your First Event

1. Check the meetup schedule on our platform
2. Note the time, date, and location
3. Mark your calendar
4. Show up

## Setting the Right Expectations

### What NOT to Expect

**No Performance Pressure:**
- You don't need to demonstrate expertise
- No one expects you to contribute technical insights immediately
- There's no test or evaluation of your skills
- You won't be put on the spot or asked to prove yourself

**No Formal Structure:**
- These aren't corporate networking events with rigid protocols
- No need for business cards or elevator pitches
- Conversations flow naturally around shared interests
- Learning happens through casual discussion, not formal presentations

### What TO Expect

**Welcoming Environment:**
- Most attendees remember being newcomers themselves
- The community generally embraces the "pay it forward" mentality
- Questions are encouraged, not judged
- Diverse experience levels in the same room

**Organic Learning:**
- Knowledge sharing happens through natural conversation
- Stories and experiences are shared freely
- Problem-solving discussions emerge spontaneously
- Mentorship relationships develop naturally

## The Power of Attitude

### Bring Your Best Self

**Good Attitude Essentials:**
- **Curiosity:** Come ready to learn from everyone you meet
- **Openness:** Be receptive to new ideas and perspectives
- **Humility:** Everyone knows something you don't, regardless of their apparent experience level
- **Enthusiasm:** Genuine interest in cybersecurity and the community

### Mindset for Success

**Focus on Connection, Not Transaction:**
- Prioritize building relationships over immediate gains
- Listen more than you speak, especially initially
- Ask genuine questions about others' experiences
- Share your own journey and interests honestly

**Embrace the Learning Opportunity:**
- Every conversation is a chance to learn something new
- Mistakes and admissions of ignorance are learning opportunities
- The goal is growth, not appearing knowledgeable

## Practical Preparation

### Essential Equipment

**Bring Your PC:**
It's **strongly encouraged** to bring your personal computer because:

**Hands-On Demonstrations:**
- Live demos of tools and techniques often happen spontaneously
- You can follow along with tutorials and workshops
- Speakers may share resources or tools to try immediately
- Collaborative troubleshooting sessions occur naturally

**Interactive Participation:**
- CTF challenges or mini-competitions might emerge
- You can take notes, access resources, and research topics discussed
- Networking tools and techniques can be demonstrated in real-time
- You're prepared for any impromptu learning opportunities

### Technical Considerations

**Laptop Setup:**
- Ensure your device is charged or bring a charger
- Have a basic security toolkit if you have one (not required)
- Consider bringing a notebook for offline notes
- Make sure your WiFi works (though venue WiFi may be limited)

**Security Awareness:**
- Be mindful of what's visible on your screen in public
- Don't access sensitive personal accounts on unfamiliar networks
- Consider using a dedicated "meetup" user account if you're particularly security-conscious

## Making the Most of Your First Experience

**Conversation Starters:**
- "What's the most interesting thing you've learned recently?"

### Participation Guidelines

**Active Listening:**
- Focus on understanding others' perspectives and experiences

- Remember names and details for future conversations

**Contributing Appropriately:**
- Share your learning journey and challenges

## Conclusion

Your first DEFCON Group meetup is the beginning of your integration into the local cybersecurity community. Remember: just show up with a good attitude, bring your computer for hands-on learning, and embrace the experience. The most important thing is your presence and willingness to engage. Everything else—expertise, contributions, leadership—will develop naturally through continued participation.

The in-person nature of these meetups is what makes them special. While digital communication has its place, there's no substitute for the energy, collaboration, and genuine connection that happens when cybersecurity enthusiasts gather in the same room. Your first meetup is the first step in a journey that could define your career and introduce you to lifelong friends and mentors.

Welcome to the community—we look forward to meeting you at the next meetup!
