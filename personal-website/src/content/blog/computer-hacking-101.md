# Computer Hacking 101

## Introduction

Computer hacking is the practice of exploring, understanding, and manipulating computer systems and networks. Contrary to popular media portrayals, hacking is not inherently illegal or maliciousâ€”it's fundamentally about curiosity, problem-solving, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

## Legal and Ethical Context

### Hacking Is Not Always Illegal

The legality of hacking depends entirely on **authorization and intent**:

**Legal Hacking:**
- Penetration testing with proper authorization
- Bug bounty programs
- Security research on your own systems
- Educational environments and labs
- Open source security auditing

**Illegal Hacking:**
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Data theft or destruction
- Fraud or financial crimes
- Privacy violations
- Disrupting services without permission

## Key Hacking Concepts

### Initial Access

**Initial Access** refers to the first step in gaining entry to a target system or network:

- **Attack Vectors:** Email phishing, vulnerable web applications, USB drops, social engineering
- **Exploitation:** Taking advantage of software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or human error
- **Persistence:** Establishing a foothold that survives reboots and basic cleanup attempts
- **Examples:** Exploiting an unpatched server, successful phishing campaign, physical access via tailgating

### Privilege Escalation

**Privilege Escalation** is the process of gaining higher-level permissions within a system:

**Vertical Escalation:**
- Moving from user-level to administrator/root access
- Exploiting system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
- Taking advantage of poorly configured services

**Horizontal Escalation:**
- Moving between accounts at the same privilege level
- Accessing different user accounts or resources
- Lateral movement across network segments

**Common Techniques:**
- Exploiting SUID/SGID binaries on Unix systems
- Windows privilege escalation via service misconfigurations
- Kernel exploits for direct system-level access
- Credential harvesting and password attacks

## Historical Foundation: The MIT Tech Model Railroad Club

### The Birth of Hacker Culture

The modern concept of "hacking" originated at MIT in the late 1950s and early 1960s, specifically within the **Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC)**:

**Key Contributions:**
- **Terminology:** The word "hack" originally meant an elegant, clever solution to a technical problem
- **Philosophy:** Emphasis on understanding systems deeply, not just using them
- **Curiosity-Driven:** Focus on learning how things work and making them work better
- **Sharing Knowledge:** Open collaboration and information exchange

**The Original Hackers:**
- Built and modified model railroad control systems
- Developed early programming techniques
- Created the foundation for what became personal computing
- Established the ethical framework that guides modern hacker culture

**Core Values Established:**
- Information wants to be free
- Access to computers should be unlimited and total
- Mistrust authority and promote decentralization
- Judge hackers by their skills, not credentials

## Red Team vs Blue Team

### Defense and Offense in Cybersecurity

The cybersecurity field is often structured around two primary roles that simulate real-world conflict:

### Blue Team (Defense)

**Role:** Protect and defend organizational systems

**Responsibilities:**
- Monitor networks and systems for threats
- Implement security controls and policies
- Incident response and forensic analysis
- Security architecture and hardening
- Compliance and risk management

**Tools and Techniques:**
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Log analysis and correlation
- Threat hunting and monitoring
- Security awareness training

### Red Team (Offense)

**Role:** Simulate real-world attacks to test defenses

**Responsibilities:**
- Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
- Social engineering campaigns
- Physical security testing
- Adversary simulation exercises
- Security control validation

**Tools and Techniques:**
- Exploitation frameworks (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike)
- Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
- Custom payload development
- Post-exploitation and persistence
- Steganography and evasion techniques

### Purple Team (Collaboration)

**Emerging Concept:** Purple teams bridge the gap between red and blue teams:
- Joint exercises and knowledge sharing
- Collaborative threat modeling
- Defensive measure effectiveness testing
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops

## Conclusion

Computer hacking, when approached ethically and legally, serves as a crucial component of modern cybersecurity. Understanding these foundational concepts, historical context, and the collaborative defensive framework helps build a solid foundation for anyone interested in cybersecurity, whether pursuing defensive (blue team) or offensive (red team) specializations.
